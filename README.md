Label-Only Membership Inference Attacks on Machine Unlearning without Dependence of Posteriors

We propose a novel membership inference attack based on predicted labels, which is the first black‚Äêbox membership inference attack against machine unlearning in the setting where the model only outputs predicted labels. The article has been received by Int J Intell Syst and is available in http://doi.org/10.1002/int.23000.
